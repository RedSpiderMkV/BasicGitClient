Basic Git client

Simple WinForms app to speed up using git commands on the command line.
Uses input/output redirection from a process running git.exe

Update
Basic functionality working for my own use.
Will look into adding more features and making it more generic

Adding/removing file functionality added.

One bug I've noticed is the failure to colour text correctly when modified/new/deleted
