#PreppieGit - Basic GitHub Client
-------------------------

Basic WinForms based git hub client to help speed up running github commands.

Uses input/output redirection from a process running git.exe.

Currently supports the commonly used, simple functions when using git but hoping to expand on this.

###TO-DO
Move file/folder manipulation to separate class and away from UI code
